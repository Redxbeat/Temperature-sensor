### **Smart Temperature & Humidity Monitor**

This is an **Internet of Things (IoT)** project that creates a real-time temperature and humidity monitoring system using an **Arduino Uno** microcontroller. The system reads data from a **DHT11 sensor** and displays it on a **16x2 LCD screen**. This project is an excellent starting point for learning about physical computing, embedded systems, and data acquisition.

-----

### **Features**

  * **Real-Time Data:** Continuously displays the current temperature in Celsius (°C) and humidity in percentage (%).
  * **Simple & Effective:** A straightforward build that demonstrates key hardware and software integration concepts.
  * **Modular Design:** Easy to expand upon, allowing for the addition of features like data logging, cloud connectivity, or a notification system.

-----

### **Components Required**

To build this project, you will need the following components:

  * **Arduino Uno**
  * **DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor**
  * **16x2 Character LCD Display**
  * **Breadboard**
  * **Jumper Wires**
  * **10kΩ Potentiometer** (for LCD contrast)
  * **Resistors** (e.g., 220Ω for backlight)

### **Circuit Diagram**

A detailed circuit diagram is essential for proper assembly. [Insert a link to a circuit diagram image or a Fritzing file here. If you don't have one, you can describe the connections.]

**Basic Connections:**

1.  **DHT11 Sensor:**

      * VCC -\> 5V on Arduino
      * GND -\> GND on Arduino
      * Data Pin -\> Digital Pin 2 on Arduino

2.  **16x2 LCD Display:**

      * Refer to standard LCD wiring tutorials. It typically involves connecting pins to power, ground, a potentiometer for contrast, and digital pins (e.g., pins 12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2).

-----

### **Software Setup**

1.  **Arduino IDE:** Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.

2.  **Libraries:** You will need to install two libraries to work with the components:

      * `DHT sensor library` by Adafruit
      * `LiquidCrystal` library (usually pre-installed with the IDE)

    You can install them via the Arduino IDE's Library Manager (`Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`). Search for "DHT sensor" and "LiquidCrystal" and install the appropriate ones.

-----

### **Code**

The core of the project is the `Arduino.ino` file. The code initializes the sensor and LCD, reads data in a loop, and displays the information.

```cpp
#include <DHT.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

// Define sensor and LCD pins
// (Code snippet from your project)

void setup() {
  // Initialize LCD and DHT sensor
}

void loop() {
  // Read sensor data
  // Display data on LCD
}
```

### **Future Enhancements**

  * **Data Logging:** Log temperature and humidity data to an SD card.
  * **Remote Monitoring:** Connect an ESP8266 or similar Wi-Fi module to send data to a cloud platform (e.g., ThingSpeak, Google Cloud IoT).
  * **Alert System:** Add a buzzer or an LED to trigger an alert when a certain temperature or humidity threshold is reached.
  * **AI/ML Integration:** Use the collected data to train a simple machine learning model to predict future temperature or humidity changes.
